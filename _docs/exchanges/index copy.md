# Benefits & Incentives for Exchanges

---
### How Can Exchanges Use and Benefit from the FIO Protocol?

How much time and money does your exchange spend with users on crypto deposit/withdrawal errors and support? Integrating the FIO Protocol gives your users friendly interwallet operability, making deposits, withdrawals and requests as easy as Venmo and near error-free. What’s more, the FIO Protocol is a Delegated Proof of Stake blockchain so FIO Tokens on your exchange can be used to vote towards block production and potentially participate in the associated token income.

*Generous Bounty Rewards + Listing + Users + Retention + Marketing + PR + Giveaways + More*

### Token Listing

The Foundation for Interwallet Operability (FIO) will facilitate listing of the FIO Token on reputable exchanges. The Foundation generally will not pay listing fees, however, there are a number of additional economic benefits to your exchange, such as immediate cost savings on deposit/withdrawal customer support, generous user bounty upside, increased marketing and demand-driving activity and possible PR.

---
### Marketing of Listing

Your exchange will have the opportunity to leverage the marketing, public relations and communications support from the Foundation to conduct a powerful joint marketing campaign and promote your new integration partnership with FIO and the token listing. To make the launch of your new FIO integration capabilities and listing a success, the Foundation will provide a mutually agreed upon FIO Token budget.

---
### FIO Address Giveaway

Your success is our success and the Foundation is prepared to support your exchange and users the very best we can. As part of the listing, the Foundation will fund the giveaway of a large number of FIO Addresses on your exchange’s unique FIO Domain for its users. A FIO Address looks like and consists of the following parts: “username@domain”. For example, “cz@binance”.

---
### User Incentives

The sky’s the limit. Exchanges that complete integration and an ability to deposit/withdrawal/request using FIO Addresses currently earn approximately $1 in FIO Tokens for each new FIO Address registered from within the exchange -- including for those given away through the FIO Address Giveaway described above.

|Number of New FIO Addresses Registered|Approximate Profit Your Exchange Earns|
|:-:|:-:|
|25,000|$25,000|
|100,000|$100,000|
|250,000|$250,000|
|1,000,000|$1,000,000|

If your exchange chooses to maintain its FIO Token bounty, these tokens can be used to add extra voting power in the Delegated Proof of Stake blockchain and potentially participate in the associated token income.

---
### Block Production

As a Delegated Proof of Stake blockchain, the FIO Protocol enables your exchange to participate in the economics and governance of block production either individually or by teaming up with other companies. Centralized exchanges will obtain FIO Tokens through the various elements described on this page and may also choose to vote with the tokens held on their exchange.  

---
### FIO Token Incentive to Exchange for Integration of FIO

Upon integration of the FIO Protocol, as a user option on their deposit/withdrawal/request pages, the Foundation will provide your exchange FIO Tokens of a mutually agreed upon amount. These tokens will be placed on a lock schedule that unwinds over time and the integration must occur before a mutually agreed upon deadline.

---
### This is Your Protocol!

The FIO Protocol was structured specifically to enable companies that provide user-facing crypto solutions, like exchanges and wallets, to economically benefit from the protocol and have the opportunity to be involved in the governance of the protocol via their FIO Token vote. In addition, exchanges have the ability to get even more involved in FIO Protocol’s future by participating in various activities coordinated by the Foundation via an emerging decentralized autonomous consortia model or even serving on the Foundation’s Board of Directors.
