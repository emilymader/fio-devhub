# Benefits & Bounties for Wallets

---
### How Can Wallets Use and Benefit from the FIO Protocol?

* ***Ability to generate income from FIO integration***
* ***Opportunity to drive new users through FIO marketing programs***
* ***Greatly enhanced user experience***

---
### Wallet Income from FIO Integration

#### Integration Payments

Wallets can earn as much as $50,000 in token payments for integrating FIO functionality (see table at end of this page)

#### User Bounties

Wallets that complete integration of FIO Address registration and ability to send and receive with FIO Addresses currently earn FIO Tokens roughly equal to $1 for each user that registers a FIO Address.  And those addresses can initially be given away for free to users as described in the marketing programs below.

#### Technology Provider ID (TPID) Fees

10% of all FIO token fees from FIO Addresses and Domains registered inside of a wallet or exchange are credited to the wallet or exchange through their TPID.

#### Block Production

The FIO Protocol automatically proxies the vote of FIO tokens held in self sovereign wallets to the company that build the wallet unless  a user takes action to vote those tokens themselves.  This  combined with the various other ways described on this page that wallets obtain FIO Tokens, enables wallets with large numbers of customers holding FIO tokens the ability to potentially participate in the economics of block production either individually or by teaming up with other companies.

#### Integration Airdrop 

Select wallets that are known to have large numbers of users may be eligible for an additional airdrop of FIO Tokens upon completion of a full FIO integration.

### Driving Additional Users for Wallets

#### FIO Address Giveaways.  

Wallets that have integrated FIO Address registration and the ability to send and receive with FIO Addresses can participate in FIO Address Giveaway campaigns.  In these campaigns the Foundation for Interwallet operability pays the ~$2 per FIO Address FIO Token fee on behalf of the wallet’s users for registering a FIO Address.  The wallet still receives a FIO Token bounty for these free FIO Addresses.

#### Participation in Exchange Listing Marketing.  

When the FIO Token is listed on exchanges there are often marketing activities around the listing. Some of those may require the users to obtain a FIO Enabled wallet.  Once sufficiently integrated, your company’s wallet would be included on that list of wallets that users can select.  In the not distant future, some exchanges will be integrating FIO into their deposit withdrawal interface and users will need a FIO enabled wallet to utilize that capability. 

#### FIO Utilization Contests.  

Once FIO Request is integrating, the Foundation will sponsor campaigns encouraging users to use the FIO Request functionality whereby, by doing so, users are entered into drawings or contests where they can win prizes that may include FIO tokens or other crypto.  

#### Future Marketing Campaigns.  

There are many additional marketing activities around registering FIO Addresses and utilizing FIO Requests that the Foundation is in process of planning.  FIO enabled wallets end up being the beneficiaries of these campaigns as users must have a FIO enabled wallet to participate. 

A Better User Experience Leads to More Users

 Until moving tokens/coins in a decentralized manner is easy and worry free, crypto will never reach mass adoption.  The FIO Protocol’s goal is to enable companies like yours to do that be solving the problems that exist between wallets, exchanges, crypto payment processing platforms, Dapps, etc.  A rising tide lifts all boats.

### This is Your Protocol!

The FIO Protocol was structured specifically to enable companies that provide user facing crypto solutions like wallets to benefit economically from the protocol and to be able to be involved in governance of the protocol via their FIO token vote.  In addition, wallets have the ability to get even more involved in the FIO Protocol’s future by participating in various activities coordinated by the Foundation via an emerging decentralized autonomous consortia model or even serving on the Foundation Board of Directors.
